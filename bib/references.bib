abstract = {The daily traffic of Short Message Service (SMS) keeps increasing. As a result, it leads to dramatic increase in mobile attacks such as spammers who plague the service with spam messages sent to the groups of recipients. Mobile spams are a growing problem as the number of spams keep increasing day by day even with the filtering systems. Spams are defined as unsolicited bulk messages in various forms such as unwanted advertisements, credit opportunities or fake lottery winner notifications. Spam classification has become more challenging due to complexities of the messages imposed by spammers. Hence, various methods have been developed in order to filter spams. In this study, methods of term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) and Random Forest Algorithm will be applied on SMS spam message data collection. Based on the experiment, Random Forest algorithm outperforms other algorithms with an accuracy of 97.50%.}

abstract={Email is one of the most popular and efficient methods of internet communication and data or message sharing. Considering the significance and high usage of emails, the number of spam emails has also increased rapidly. Spam emails are unwanted emails that contains various contents like advertisements, offers, malicious links, malware, trojan, etc. Spammers send junk mails with an intention of committing email fraud, thus it is important to filter spam emails from emails. The motivation of this research is to build email spam detection models by using machine learning and deep learning techniques so that spam emails can be distinguished from legitimate emails with high accuracy. The Enron email dataset has been used and deep learning models are developed to detect and classify new email spam using LSTM and BERT. NLP approach was applied to analyze and perform data preprocessing of the text of the email. The results are compared to the previous models in email spam detection. The proposed deep learning approach obtained the highest accuracy of 99.14% using BERT, 98.34% using BiLSTM and 97.15% using LSTM. Python is utilized for all implementations.},

  abstract={E-mails are used effectively by people or communities who want to do propaganda, advertisement, and phishing because of their ease of use and low cost. People or communities who want to achieve their goals send unnecessary and spam to the e-mail accounts they never knew. These mails cause serious financial and moral damages to internet users and also engage in internet traffic. Unsolicited e-mails (spam) are a method sent to the recipient without their consent and generally for malicious or promotional purposes. In this study, spam was detected with Keras deep learning library on the Turkish dataset. Turkish email dataset contains 800 e-mails, half of which are spam e-mails. With the deep learning algorithm long short term memory (LSTM), a 100% accuracy rate has been achieved in the Turkish e-mail dataset.}

  abstract={Social media provides a forum for constructive discussion while also providing an environment that is conducive to cyberbullying. Cyberstalking is a growing problem, especially on social media sites like Facebook. It is defined as harassment that occurs online without any physical contact. To mitigate its negative effects, automated procedures for locating and removing cyberbullying content must be put in place. The intent of this research is to broaden the scope of cyberbullying detection, with an emphasis on Assamese. Due to the limited digital resources, Assamese has not received much consideration in previous research. The primary goal of this research is to fill the notable gap in the identification of cyberbullying, specifically in populations who are linguistically marginalised, by focusing on Assamese. Research findings show that LSTM obtained an accuracy of 87.86%, Bi-LSTM attained 89.58% and the hybrid model, LSTM and Bi-LSTM, surpass all with a remarkable accuracy of 89.7%. The research methodology introduces an innovative hybrid approach that melds Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models with Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM), specifically designed to accommodate the unique linguistic characteristics and challenges of Assamese. The results of the research demonstrate the hybrid model's efficacy in identifying cyberbullying in Assamese, indicating its potential utility in improving security when surfing the internet.},

  abstract={Today, online media applications are an important source of information. People are creating and sharing more information than ever before around the world. Being provided by unreliable sources, some news can be misleading. In fact, the assessment of the correctness of the news can be region related. In other words, news can be true in a specific region while fake in another. Existing proposed solutions for fake news detection developed in centralized platforms are not considering the location from where the news gets announced, but they are focused more on the news content. In this paper, a region-based distributed fake news detection framework is proposed. The framework is deployed in a mobile crowdsensing (MCS) environment where a set of workers responsible for collecting news are selected based on their availability in a specific region. The selected workers share the news to the nearest edge node, where the pre-processing and detection of fake news are executed locally. The detection process uses a pre-trained BERT model where it achieved an accuracy of 91 %.}

  abstract={The explosion of Internet information makes timely analysis and monitoring of Internet public opinion more and more important, and sentiment analysis of public opinion events is even more important. The traditional word2vec model cannot fully express the information contained in words. It is proposed to use the BERT model as the article feature extraction model, and use the deep convolutional neural network to extract the local information of the article, and then connect the fully connected network to classify the article, so as to achieve sentiment analysis purpose. Experimental results on public data sets show that sentiment analysis algorithms based on BERT and convolutional neural networks are better than traditional sentiment analysis algorithms.},

  abstract={The volume of SMS messages sent on a daily basis globally has continued to grow significantly over the past years. Hence, mobile phones are becoming increasingly vulnerable to SMS spam messages, thereby exposing users to the risk of fraud and theft of personal data. Filtering of messages to detect and eliminate SMS spam is now a critical functionality for which different types of machine learning approaches are still being explored. In this paper, we propose a system for detecting SMS spam using a semi-supervised novelty detection approach based on one class SVM classifier. The system is built as an anomaly detector that learns only from normal SMS messages thus enabling detection models to be implemented in the absence of labelled SMS spam training examples. We evaluated our proposed system using a benchmark dataset consisting of 747 SMS spam and 4827 non-spam messages. The results show that our proposed method out-performed the traditional supervised machine learning approaches based on binary, frequency or TF-IDF bag-of-words. The overall accuracy was 98% with 100% SMS spam detection rate and only around 3% false positive rate.}

  abstract={In order to realize the analysis of the emotional tendency of the product user reviews. This paper proposes a method for analyzing the sentiment orientation of product reviews based on the BERT-BiLSTM-ATT model. First, use the BERT model to obtain the feature representation of the product review text, and then input the obtained feature representation into the BiLSTM network to extract the emotional features of the product review. Add an Attention layer before the output layer of the normal BiLSTM model to further improve the classification accuracy, and finally combine with Softmax The classifier classifies the extracted features. To validate the algorithm, the design and LSTM, BiLSTM, BiLSTM-ATT, BERTBiLSTM comparative model experiments, experimental results show that the algorithm accuracy on test set are improved 6.17%, 3.75%, 2.83%, 1.03%, to prove the effectiveness of this method in the relevant classification task.},

  abstract={Opinions for any product, topic or organization are provided by users on Social networking and E-commerce sites. These opinions have high influence on other users’ purchasing decisions. Spammers post fake opinions so that their organization’s product can be promoted and competitor’s product can be demoted. There is need for detecting spam opinions so that users can have fair information about any product. Review text and reviewer behavior are factors considered to detect spam opinions. Traditional machine learning techniques such as SVM, Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes are applied to distinguish spam opinions from original reviews, but accuracy is not adequate. Furthermore, traditional approaches use only bag-of-words representation which do not consider context of words. In this research work, reviews text are observed and fed into Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. Convolutional layers, number of hidden layers, dense layers and filter size are set to build model. Further, essential text features are included in CNN model to improve accuracy. GloVe word embedding is used in proposed model. Experiment analysis on Ott dataset proves that accuracy is improved significantly by proposed model as compared to traditional machine learning approaches.}

  abstract = {Anything that is connected to the internet is vulnerable, for example mobile phones, personal laptops, tablets, routers, and smart speakers. Cybercriminals need one point of weakness like unprotected devices or a weak password or any attachment to potentially enter into the system. There is a need to pause before proceeding with any mail or downloading any document or accessing any link in a message because there is a risk of phishing. Every day 320 billion spam emails are sent to many people. According to statistics of spam mail, it was noted that out of every 3000 emails, 1 mail is spam that contains phishing links, malware, fake messages, fake offers, etc. The hacker tries to get confidential information about people, companies, and bank account details. In 2023, Spam mails are still a big real-life problem because some people are still not aware of spam emails and they aren’t able to detect spam mail manually. So, there is a need for the development of a spam detector system that can detect spam emails with higher accuracy. In this paper, there will be a discussion about implementation, execution and obtained results of deep learning algorithms like LSTM (one-directional), BiLSTM (Bi-directional), BERT, and Convolution Neural Networks using a dataset that was downloaded from Kaggle. An accuracy of 98% was obtained with the CNN, 96% was obtained with the LSTM (one-directional) model, 97% with the BiLSTM (Bi-directional) model, and 99% was obtained with the BERT model. The best accuracy ‘of 99%’ with great recall value, less precision, and a great F1 score was attained by implementing the BERT model for spam detection. Keywords-Deep Learning, CIA, SIANN, RFC}
